## Michael Ellerd Dobbs – President

Michael started his career in the hotel business as accountant and tax consultant. He quickly achieved success, and within a few years was Chief Financial Officer of a large hotel corporation in Southern California. In 1983 he formed Ellerd Business Services, an accounting and tax service in Orange County, California, serving individual and corporate clients in both the U.S. and Canada. Since then, his business has expanded to include all forms of financial services with a focus on bottom line performance and tax liability management. Michael has been supporting individuals and businesses on a wide range of tax and accounting issues for more than 25 years.

## Marie Simon – Vice President, Manager

Marie has been with Ellerd Business Services for 15 years, and has proven herself time and again. Her management skills are stellar and she has transformed the company into a mecca of efficiency. Marie is the backbone of our company and is responsible for making sure that all our services are provided on time and to the best of our ability, she’s the “quality” in Quality Controller.

Marie was recruited by IBM in her early career, and for 25 years she excelled and rose to ever higher management positions. Eventually she left IBM to raise a family and has finally come into our family, and we’re so glad she did.
